## Acknowledgment
* This project is not part of the Google Games & Apps Academy. But I made this project to apply what I learned during the Academy and to get used to the Unity game engine.
* I want to thank everyone responsible for this Academy, especially to the instructor Tolgay Hickiran, giving us the opportunity to learn Unity.
